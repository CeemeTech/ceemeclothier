    <p>HOW IT ALL STARTED</p>
        <p>Ceeme Clothiers was originally conceptualized as an online store but ultimately a physical store was opened instead in 2010 
        and has been open since then.</p> 
        <p>Ceeme Clothiers was founded by Oluremi SimileJesu aka Ceeme who is the ultimate fashion enthusiast.</p> 
        <p>His interest, and passion for fashion trends, and style is unparalleled and dates far back as when he was in high school.</p>

        <p>He studied Music at the Mount Allison University Canada and obtained a Master’s degree in Musical Composition at the same University. </p>
            <P> However, He couldn’t resist what would appear to be his passion and immediately launched Ceeme Clothiers Flagship store after returning home to Lagos from Canada.</P>
            <p>Since then, he has built Ceeme Clothiers to be a reputable and sought after for both Men and women’s clothing store in Lagos Nigeria.</p>
             <p>If there is that event/occasion be it a Wedding, concert, dinner date, clubbing etc. C.C today is one of the top destinations for men and women ages 16-45 to find that befitting outfit worthy of the occasion in Lagos. </p>
             <p>He has since launched another store in Accra, Ghana December 2019, and C.C has quickly risen to become the “Goto” in Accra today.</p>
